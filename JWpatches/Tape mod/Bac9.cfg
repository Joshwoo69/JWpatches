{
@title = SN TAPE Connector
  @description = Long-overdue redesign of the all-important TAPE connector. The TAPE connector is highly regarded by many spacecraft engineers as they help in constructing more stable spacecraft. Once both sides are connected, a structural beam is created to link both ends, allowing for sturdier (and heavier) construction.
